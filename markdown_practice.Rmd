I am now changing the markdown file to include my own script for BCI metabarcoding data.
This analysis relies hevily on tutorial for the metacoder package from the Grunwald Lab.
https://grunwaldlab.github.io/metacoder_documentation/example.html

```{r, message = FALSE}
#the small green box to insert chunks in different formats. 
#```{r} for R, message =FALSE is to avoid seeing messages from this whole chunk, in this case, any warning coming from loading R packages (e.g. version warning, masking, etc)
rm(list=ls()) #reoves all objects in workspace, start with clean environment
#load packages
library('tidyr')
library('dplyr')
library('metacoder')

```

First thing is to merge and clean the samples from the format downloaded from mbrave
```{r}
all_merged <- read.csv('data/light_trap_19_21.csv', header=T)
head(all_merged)
```

# metabarcoding
Analyzing metabarcoding data using Metacoder and MicrobiotaProcess
This project uses COI metabarcoding data from two nights of light-trapping at Barro Colorado Island.
The project aims at describing biodiversity classified through BOLD's mBrave platform based on BINs, and then compare it to biodiversity classified through the ForestGeo Arthrpod Initiative (tradiditional taxonomy and barcoding).
